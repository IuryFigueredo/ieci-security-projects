# 🛡️ Network Security & Reconnaissance

**IECI Security Projects | 2025/2026**

This repository contains a dual-component project developed for the **Introduction to Computer and Informatics Engineering (IECI)** curricular unit, part of the **BSc in Computer and Informatics Engineering** program.

The project integrates a **technical LaTeX report** on network reconnaissance (Footprinting & Scanning) with an **interactive web dashboard** for system vulnerability analysis. It provides a rigorous evaluation of TCP/ICMP communication protocols and stealth scanning methodologies, framed within the ethical and legal responsibilities of a Computer Engineer.
